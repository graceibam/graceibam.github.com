====================
1. The assignment was completed according to the set guidelines. Two CSS files, each with over
	five rules were written, and three html documents pages were completed: one homepage, one
	bio and one resume. There are no styling rules in the html documents. All html documents pass
	the validation specs for html5 and all the CSS sheets pass CSS validation. 

2. I discussed the assignment with Tom Geheran.

3. I spent about 5 or 6 hours on this assignment.
