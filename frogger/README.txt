1. All basic criteria of the assignment were completed. Additionally, the three additional implementations that were incorporated into the game are the rendering 
	of the image of the dead frog when it dies, sound indicating when frogger is moving or when he dies, and level progression, wherein the logs and cars move
	faster every five times frogger is brought home safely. 
2. I discussed the assignment with Tom Geheran.
3. I spent about fifteen+ hours on this assignment. 

**note** The sprite sheet is located in the main frogger folder, since it was not functioning correctly when it was saved in the assets folder.
