<p>
Is this the real life?<br/>
Is this just fantasy?<br/>
Caught in a landslide,<br/>
No escape from reality.<br/>
Open your eyes,<br/>
Look up to the skies and see,<br/>
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,<br/>
Because I'm easy come, easy go,<br/>
Little high, little low,<br/>
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.<br/>
</p>

<p>
Mama, just killed a man,<br/>
Put a gun against his head,<br/>
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.<br/>
Mama, life had just begun,<br/>
But now I've gone and thrown it all away.<br/>
Mama, ooh,<br/>
Didn't mean to make you cry,<br/>
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,<br/>
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Too late, my time has come,<br/>
Sends shivers down my spine,<br/>
Body's aching all the time.<br/>
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,<br/>
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.<br/>
Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows),<br/>
I don't wanna die,<br/>
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I see a little silhouetto of a man,<br/>
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?<br/>
Thunderbolt and lightning,<br/>
Very, very frightening me.<br/>
(Galileo) Galileo.<br/>
(Galileo) Galileo,<br/>
Galileo Figaro<br/>
Magnifico.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me.<br/>
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,<br/>
Spare him his life from this monstrosity.<br/>
</p>

<p>
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go.<br/>
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go.<br/>
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go.<br/>
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go.<br/>
(Let me go) Will not let you go.<br/>
(Let me go) Will not let you go.<br/>
(Let me go) Ah.<br/>
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<br/>
(Oh, mama mia, mama mia) Mama mia, let me go.<br/>
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.<br/>
</p>

<p>
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye.<br/>
So you think you can love me and leave me to die.<br/>
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,<br/>
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.<br/>
</p>

<p>
Nothing really matters,<br/>
Anyone can see,<br/>
Nothing really matters,<br/>
Nothing really matters to me.<br/>
</p>
